title: Switch
description: Understand what a network switch is, how it differs from a hub, and where it's used in modern LAN environments.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

A **network switch** is a device that connects devices in a local area network (LAN) and forwards data intelligently using **MAC addresses**.

> It operates at **Layer 2** of the OSI model and sends data only to the intended recipient, unlike a hub which broadcasts to all devices.

---

## How a Switch Works

When a device sends data, the switch checks the destination **MAC address** and forwards the frame only to the appropriate port.

Switches **learn** the MAC addresses of connected devices by analyzing incoming traffic, storing them in a **MAC address table**.

## Analogy

> A switch is like a receptionist who delivers mail directly to each employee's desk, rather than shouting across the office.

---

## Pros

- Efficient, reduces network congestion
- More secure than hubs
- Supports full-duplex communication

## Cons

- More costly than hubs
- Cannot route between networks (needs router)

---

## Use Cases

- Office LANs
- Homes with wired Ethernet setups
- Server farms and data centers

## Switch vs. Hub

| Feature       | Switch                    | Hub               |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Data Handling | Forwards to specific port | Broadcasts to all |
| OSI Layer     | Layer 2                   | Layer 1           |
| Performance   | High                      | Low               |

## Summary

Switches form the backbone of modern LANs by **efficiently managing data traffic**. Understanding how they work helps in designing and troubleshooting scalable networks.
