Networking relies on various **hardware devices** that perform specific roles in **data transmission**, **traffic control**, **signal processing**, and **network security**. Each device operates at different layers of the OSI model and serves a distinct purpose in the overall architecture.

Understanding the function of each device is essential for designing, managing, and securing a network effectively.

## OSI Layer Overview

| **Device**              | **OSI Layer**        | **Purpose**                           |
|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Repeater                | Layer 1 (Physical)    | Boosts signal strength                 |
| Hub                     | Layer 1 (Physical)    | Broadcasts data to all devices         |
| Bridge                  | Layer 2 (Data Link)   | Filters traffic between segments       |
| Switch                  | Layer 2 (Data Link)   | Directs traffic based on MAC addresses |
| Router                  | Layer 3 (Network)     | Routes data between networks           |
| Modem                   | Layer 1 (Physical)    | Converts digital to analog and vice versa |
| Wireless Access Point   | Layer 2 (Data Link)   | Connects wireless devices to LAN       |
| Firewall                | Layer 3–7             | Controls and secures traffic           |

## Summary

Each network device plays a vital role in how data is transmitted, routed, extended, or secured. Whether you're building a **home LAN** or designing a **corporate enterprise network**, knowing what each component does helps you create more **efficient**, **reliable**, and **secure** infrastructures.
