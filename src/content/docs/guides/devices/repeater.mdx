title: Repeater  
description: Learn what a repeater is, how it extends network signals, and when it’s used in networking environments.
---

A **repeater** is a device that receives a network signal, **amplifies** it, and **retransmits** it to extend the range of the network.

> It works at **Layer 1 (Physical)** of the OSI model and is used to overcome distance limitations in wired or wireless networks.

---

## How It Works

As signals travel over cables or air, they degrade. A repeater takes this weakened signal, regenerates it, and sends it forward with full strength.

## Analogy

> A repeater is like a signal booster on a hiking trail that repeats emergency radio messages further up the mountain.

## Pros

- Extends signal range
- Simple and cost-effective
- Transparent to network protocols

## Cons

- Cannot filter or manage traffic
- Adds slight delay
- Doesn’t work well in noisy environments

---

## Use Cases

- Long Ethernet runs beyond 100 meters
- Extending Wi-Fi range in large buildings
