Network cables are the **physical medium** that connects computers, switches, routers, and other devices in a network. While wireless is common today, wired connections are still essential for **speed**, **security**, and **stability**.

> A **network cable** transmits data signals between devices in a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN).

Let’s explore the most commonly used cable types in modern networking.

---

## 1. Coaxial Cable

**Coaxial cables** (or *coax*) consist of a central copper conductor, surrounded by insulation, a braided shield, and an outer jacket.

> Originally used for TV signals, coax was one of the first cable types used in Ethernet networks.

**Common types**: RG-6, RG-59

**Pros:**

- Durable and resistant to interference
- Long-distance signal transmission
- Good for broadband and cable TV

**Cons:**

- Bulky and less flexible
- Slower data rates than newer options
- Largely replaced in modern LANs

**Use cases**: Older Ethernet (10Base2, 10Base5), broadband internet, CCTV

## 2. Twisted Pair Cable

This is the most widely used cable type for LANs. It consists of **pairs of copper wires twisted together**, which reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI).

There are two types:

### Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)

- Common in homes and offices
- No shielding; relies on twists to reduce noise

### Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)

- Includes additional shielding to block EMI
- Used in environments with high interference

**Categories**:  
- **Cat5e** – up to 100 Mbps–1 Gbps  
- **Cat6 / 6a** – up to 10 Gbps  
- **Cat7 / 8** – higher performance, shielded

**Pros:**

- Flexible and easy to install
- Affordable
- Supports high-speed data transfer

**Cons:**

- Limited distance (up to 100 meters)
- Susceptible to interference (UTP)

**Use cases**: Ethernet (10/100/1000Base-T), VoIP, home and enterprise networks

## 3. Fiber Optic Cable

Fiber optic cables use **light pulses** instead of electrical signals to transmit data. They consist of a **glass or plastic core**, cladding, and a protective jacket.

There are two types:

### Single-Mode Fiber (SMF)

- Thin core (~9 µm)
- Long-distance, high-bandwidth (up to 100 km)

### Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF)

- Thicker core (~50–62.5 µm)
- Shorter distances (up to 2 km)
- Lower cost for LANs

**Pros:**

- Very high bandwidth
- Immune to electromagnetic interference
- Secure and reliable

**Cons:**

- More expensive
- Fragile and harder to install

**Use cases**: Data centers, long-distance ISP backbones, high-speed WAN links

## Comparison Table

| **Cable Type** | **Speed**       | **Max Distance** | **EMI Resistance** | **Cost**       | **Use Case**                     |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Coaxial        | Low–Medium       | ~500 m           | Moderate           | Low–Medium     | TV, broadband, legacy Ethernet   |
| Twisted Pair   | Medium–High      | ~100 m           | Low (UTP), High (STP) | Low–Medium  | Home/office LAN, Ethernet        |
| Fiber Optic    | Very High        | Up to 100+ km    | Very High          | High           | Backbone, ISP, long-haul WAN     |

## Summary

Network cables are the **foundation of wired communication**. Choosing the right type depends on:

- **Speed and distance requirements**
- **Budget**
- **Environmental interference**
- **Application (LAN, WAN, ISP, etc.)**
