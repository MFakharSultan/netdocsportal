title: Hub  
description: Understand the role of a hub in network communication and why it has been largely replaced by switches.
---

A **hub** is a basic network device that connects multiple computers and **broadcasts** incoming data to all connected devices.

> Operates at **Layer 1 (Physical)** of the OSI model.

---

## How It Works

When a device sends data to the hub, the hub copies that data and forwards it to **every** connected device, regardless of destination.

## Analogy

> A hub is like a group text message where everyone receives the message—even if it’s not meant for them.

## Pros

- Inexpensive
- Simple setup

## Cons

- Broadcasts all data (no security)
- Network congestion increases with traffic
- Obsolete in most networks

---

## Use Cases

- Legacy small networks
- Educational labs for demonstration
