title: Bridge  
description: Learn how a bridge connects network segments and helps reduce collision domains in LANs.
---

A **bridge** is used to divide a large network into **smaller segments** and filter traffic between them.

> It works at **Layer 2 (Data Link)** of the OSI model and uses **MAC addresses** to forward or block data.

---

## How It Works

The bridge inspects incoming frames and decides whether to forward them to another segment based on the destination MAC address.

## Analogy

> A bridge is like a hallway monitor who decides whether someone can pass from one classroom to another.

## Pros

- Reduces collisions by segmenting traffic
- Works with legacy devices
- Transparent to upper-layer protocols

## Cons

- Slower than switches
- Limited functionality

---

## Use Cases

- Dividing traffic in small LANs
- Connecting two older network segments
