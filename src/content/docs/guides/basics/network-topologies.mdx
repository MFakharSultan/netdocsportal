So far, we’ve explored **what [networks](/guides/basics/introduction) are** and the **[types of networks](/guides/basics/types-of-computer-networks)** that exist. But how are the devices inside a network actually connected to one another?

That’s where **network topology** comes in.

> A **network topology** is the way devices (or nodes) are arranged and connected in a network. It defines both the **physical layout** (actual wires, devices) and the **logical flow** of data.

Just like streets and paths in a city determine how people move, a topology decides how data travels from one device to another in a network.

## Why Topology Matters

Choosing the right topology affects:

- **Performance** – how fast data can move.
- **Reliability** – how the network handles failures.
- **Cost** – how much it takes to build and maintain.
- **Scalability** – how easily it can grow.

Let’s look at the most common types of network topologies.

---

## 1. Bus Topology – A Single Shared Line

In a **bus topology**, all devices are connected to a **single central cable** (called a "bus").

Data travels in both directions on this line. Only one device can send data at a time, and if the main cable fails, the entire network goes down.

> Imagine people shouting down a hallway—only one person can talk at a time, and if the hallway collapses, no one can communicate.

**Pros:**

- Easy and cheap to set up
- Good for small networks

**Cons:**

- Not scalable
- Performance drops as more devices are added
- One cable failure breaks the whole network

---

## 2. Star Topology – Hub in the Center

A **star topology** connects all devices to a **central hub or switch**. Data flows from one device to the hub, and then to the destination device.

> Think of it like a wheel, with the hub in the middle and spokes connecting each device.

/>

**Pros:**

- Easy to manage and add devices
- One cable failure won’t crash the whole network

**Cons:**

- If the hub fails, everything stops
- Requires more cables than bus

---

## 3. Ring Topology – Data Goes in a Circle

In a **ring topology**, each device connects to exactly two others, forming a **closed loop**. Data travels in one direction around the ring until it reaches its destination.

> Think of it like passing a note around a circular table—everyone has to wait their turn.

/>

**Pros:**

- Predictable data flow
- No data collisions

**Cons:**

- One broken connection can affect the whole network
- Difficult to troubleshoot

---

## 4. Mesh Topology – Everyone Talks to Everyone

In a **mesh topology**, every device is connected to **every other device** in the network. This offers multiple paths for data to travel.

> It’s like a group chat where everyone is directly connected to everyone else.

<Image

/>

**Pros:**

- Very reliable and fault-tolerant
- Great for critical systems

**Cons:**

- Very expensive and complex to set up
- Not practical for large networks

---

## 5. Hybrid Topology – Best of All Worlds

A **hybrid topology** combines two or more different topologies. For example, a star of rings or a bus of stars.

This allows you to **customize** the network based on specific needs—performance in one area, cost savings in another.

> It’s like designing a city with roads, subways, and bike lanes all working together.

<Image

/>

**Pros:**

- Flexible and scalable
- Optimized for various needs

**Cons:**

- Can be complex to manage
- Higher cost than simpler topologies

## Comparison Table

| **Topology** | **Structure**              | **Reliability** | **Cost**  | **Ease of Setup** | **Best Use Case**                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Bus**      | All devices on one cable   | Low             | Low       | Easy              | Small, temporary networks           |
| **Star**     | Devices connect to a hub   | Moderate        | Moderate  | Easy              | Home or office LANs                 |
| **Ring**     | Devices in a loop          | Low–Moderate    | Moderate  | Moderate          | Networks needing ordered flow       |
| **Mesh**     | Each device to every other | Very High       | Very High | Complex           | Military, banking, critical systems |
| **Hybrid**   | Combination of topologies  | High            | Varies    | Complex           | Large, scalable enterprise setups   |

## Summary

Network topologies are like the **blueprints** of how devices are connected. Each topology has its strengths and weaknesses, depending on the needs of the network—speed, reliability, cost, or size.

Understanding topologies helps you design smarter networks and troubleshoot them more effectively.

<Aside type="note">
  In the next chapter, we will explore network models—such as the OSI model and
  the TCP/IP model—that enable these topologies to function in real-world
  scenarios.
