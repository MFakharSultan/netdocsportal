Before diving deeper into advanced networking concepts, it’s important to understand the **different types of computer networks**. Just like people build different types of relationships—based on who is involved and what the relationship is for—computers also connect in different ways, depending on the purpose, location, and scale.

Some networks are small and personal. Others can span across cities, or even the entire world.

Let’s explore the four main types of computer networks.

### 1. Local Area Network (LAN)

A **Local Area Network (LAN)** connects computers and other devices within a **small area**, such as a home, office, or school. These networks are usually fast, private, and limited to a single building or a small group of buildings.

If you've used Wi-Fi at home to connect your phone, laptop, or printer, then you've already used a LAN.

> **Think of LAN** as your local network that keeps your devices talking to each other under one roof.

### 2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

A **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** connects multiple LANs across a **city or a large campus**. These networks are larger than a LAN but not as widespread as a WAN.

For example, a university might have several buildings—like lecture halls, libraries, and labs—all connected by a MAN so that students and staff can access shared resources from anywhere on campus.

> **Think of MAN** as a city-wide network that links together different locations under one system.

### 3. Wide Area Network (WAN)

A **Wide Area Network (WAN)** connects devices and smaller networks across **large distances**—from cities and countries to entire continents.

The best example of a WAN is the **internet**. It allows computers all over the world to communicate, share files, and access information in seconds.

> **Think of WAN** as a global highway system that connects everything together, no matter how far apart.

### 4. Personal Area Network (PAN)

A **Personal Area Network (PAN)** is much smaller than the others. It connects devices within just a few meters—usually around a single person.

For instance, your smartphone, wireless earbuds, smartwatch, and laptop might all connect via Bluetooth. These short-range connections form a PAN.

> **Think of PAN** as your personal space of connected devices, just for you.

## Comparison Table

Here’s a quick look at how these network types compare:

| **Network Type** | **Area Covered**     | **Common Example**                      | **Speed**        | **Who Manages It?**      |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| **PAN**          | A few meters         | Phone ↔ Smartwatch, Bluetooth earphones | Low to Moderate  | Individual user          |
| **LAN**          | A building or room   | Home Wi-Fi, Office network              | High             | Individual or business   |
| **MAN**          | City or large campus | University network, municipal Wi-Fi     | Moderate to High | City or institution      |
| **WAN**          | Country or global    | Internet, corporate global network      | Varies           | Internet providers, ISPs |

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned that **computer networks** come in different types depending on how far they reach and what they are used for. From personal networks like PANs to global ones like WANs, each type plays a unique role in how computers communicate.

Understanding these basic types helps us see how information flows—from our homes to the world—and prepares us to explore more advanced topics like wireless networks, VPNs, and network design.
