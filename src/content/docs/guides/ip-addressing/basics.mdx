Every device on a network—computers, phones, servers—needs a unique way to identify itself. This is where **IP addresses** come in.

> An **IP address (Internet Protocol address)** is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. It allows data to find the right destination.

Think of it as a **home address** for your device, telling the network where to deliver information.

## Why IP Addresses Matter

IP addresses are crucial for:

- **Device identification** – Every machine must have a unique address.
- **Communication** – Data needs a destination and a return path.
- **Routing** – Routers use IP addresses to forward data to the right place.

## Types of IP Addresses

There are two main versions of IP addresses in use:

### IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)

- Format: `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
- Each segment ranges from `0–255`
- **32-bit address** space
- Approximately **4.3 billion** unique addresses

> Example: `172.16.254.1`

### IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)

- Format: Eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`)
- **128-bit address** space
- Provides **trillions** of unique addresses
- Designed to replace IPv4 due to address exhaustion

## Public vs. Private IP Addresses

| **Type**   | **Scope**            | **Used For**                  | **Example**            |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Public** | Globally routable    | Internet-facing devices       | `8.8.8.8`              |
| **Private**| Local area networks  | Devices within home/office    | `192.168.0.10`         |

> Private IP addresses are not accessible from the public internet. They are typically used behind a **NAT** (Network Address Translation) router.

---

## Static vs. Dynamic IPs

- **Static IP**: Manually assigned, does not change.
  - Use case: servers, printers, or critical infrastructure.
- **Dynamic IP**: Assigned automatically by a DHCP server and may change over time.
  - Use case: most home users and mobile devices.

## IP Address Structure (IPv4)

An IPv4 address has **two parts**:

1. **Network ID** – identifies the network
2. **Host ID** – identifies the device within that network

This division is determined by the **subnet mask**.

> Example:  
> IP: `192.168.1.10`  
> Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`  
> → Network: `192.168.1.0`, Host: `.10`

## Subnetting (Intro)

**Subnetting** is the practice of dividing a network into smaller logical groups.

- Improves performance and security
- Reduces broadcast traffic
- Common in enterprise networks

## Common IPv4 Address Ranges

| **Purpose**         | **Range**               | **Notes**                       |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Private (Class A)   | `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255` | Used in large private networks  |
| Private (Class B)   | `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255` | Medium-sized networks          |
| Private (Class C)   | `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255` | Most common for home routers |
| Loopback            | `127.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255` | Refers to the local device     |
| APIPA (Link-local)  | `169.254.0.0 – 169.254.255.255` | Automatic assignment when DHCP fails |

## Summary

An IP address is like a **digital address** for your device, enabling communication across local and global networks. Whether using IPv4 or IPv6, public or private, understanding IP addresses is foundational to managing and securing any network.
